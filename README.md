# ðŸ§  Brain CT Scan Classification with CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify brain CT scans as either **normal** or **hemorrhage**. It's a practical deep learning application for medical image classification, implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

## ðŸ§¾ Project Overview

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
We aim to train a deep learning model that can accurately detect hemorrhages in CT scan images of the brain. This is critical in medical diagnostics, where rapid identification can be life-saving.
